# Polytope Examples for DT Data Access

This repository describes the process for accessing Destination Earth DT data via the Polytope web service hosted on the LUMI Databridge.

To run the examples in this repository, you simply need to:

1. Install polytope-client from PyPI:
```
pip install polytope-client
```

2. Register for an ECMWF account* at ecmwf.int and retrieve your API key from https://api.ecmwf.int/v1/key/

3. Modify the example scripts in this repository to include your email address and API key. Or alternatively see the documentation at https://github.com/ecmwf/polytope-client to see how to set this globally.


\* Note that in the future it will be possible to use Destination Earth credentials.
